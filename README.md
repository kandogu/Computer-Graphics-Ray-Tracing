This assignment includes the following Folder and Files:

Executable:

	rayTracing.html

Source:

	rayTracing.js

	Common

Render Examples:

	3_wall_mirror.png

	back_wall_mirror.png

	camera1.png

	camera2.png

	camera3.png
	
The first two files were written by us, and the Common files were taken from shared codes as course content. Render Examples directory
includes sample screenshots from the application.


In order to run the project, the file structure must not be changed. Since the project was coded using the Google Chrome Browser environment,
the person who will use it should also use this environment in order to prevent errors in the operation of the project. 


You can run the project by using the file named "raytracing.html" by opening it on Google Chrome Browser. It should be noted that it tooks a bit
time to create the scene, so you should wait for whole scene to be rendered. 


We implemented:

The sphere, cube and the cone

Point light sources with a Phong lighting model

Solid objects

Shiny surfaces

Transparent objects

Environment for the objects (scene visually interesting)

Separate and Intersecting objects

moving camera (you can see from the screenshots named camera1.png, camera2.png and camera3.png) 

We did not implemented: 

texture mapping and bump mapping
